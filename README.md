## Location Services

### Browser Geolocation
The app uses the browser's built-in geolocation API to get the user's current location. Users will be prompted to allow location access.

### Location Permissions
- **Granted**: Full functionality with nearby hospital search
- **Denied**: Users can still search hospitals by name
- **Unavailable**: Fallback to manual location entry

### Privacy & Security
- Location data is only stored with user consent
- All location data is encrypted in transit
- Users can delete their location data at any time

## Hospital Data

### Sample Data
The app includes sample hospital data for testing and demonstration:
- General hospitals with emergency services
- Specialty medical centers
- Clinics and urgent care facilities
- Emergency care centers

### Real Hospital Data Integration
To integrate with real hospital data:

1. **Healthcare APIs**: Integrate with healthcare provider APIs
2. **Government Databases**: Use public health department databases
3. **Third-party Services**: Connect to services like Google Places API
4. **Manual Data Entry**: Admin interface for hospital data management

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **React 19**: Modern React with hooks and concurrent features
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server

### Backend
